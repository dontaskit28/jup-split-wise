# Jup Split Wise

A Flutter application for managing group expenses, splitting bills, and tracking payments among friends or groups — inspired by apps like Splitwise — but powered by Solana and Jupiter for seamless token-based settlements.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Traditional expense-splitting apps assume all users deal in the same currency or payment method. But in the crypto world, users often hold different tokens across different wallets.

**Jup Split Wise solves this** by enabling:
- Group members to **contribute using any Solana token** (e.g., BONK, JUP, SOL)
- The system to **auto-swap contributions into a preferred token** (like USDC) using Jupiter Swap API
- The bill creator to **receive full payment in their chosen token**, no matter what tokens friends contribute

**Example:**
> Rent bill = ₹15,000 (~180 USDC)  
> Friend A pays 500,000 BONK  
> Friend B pays 2 JUP  
> → All are auto-swapped and settled to 180 USDC into the bill owner's wallet.

### 🧑‍💻 User Flow

1. User opens the app and connects their **Phantom wallet** via `wallet-adapter`.
2. They create a **bill** (e.g., rent, trip, party) — selecting:
   - Group members
   - Total amount
   - Preferred token to receive (e.g., USDC)
3. The app generates a **QR code** for others to scan and join the group.
4. Each member pays in **any supported Solana token** (BONK, JUP, SOL, etc.)
5. The payment is **auto-swapped to the creator's token** (e.g., USDC) via **Jupiter Aggregator**.
6. All group/bill/split/payment data is stored in **Supabase** (PostgreSQL + Auth).

## Main Models

- [coins_data.dart](lib/models/coins_data.dart): Manages supported coins/currencies for splitting.
- [expense_model.dart](lib/models/expense_model.dart): Represents an expense, with details like amount, payer, and group.
- [group_model.dart](lib/models/group_model.dart): Represents a group, including members and expenses.
- [member_model.dart](lib/models/member_model.dart): Represents a group member.
- [split_model.dart](lib/models/split_model.dart): Handles the logic for splitting expenses.

## Main Screens

- [login_screen.dart](lib/screens/login_screen.dart): User authentication and login UI.
- [home_screen.dart](lib/screens/home_screen.dart): Main dashboard displaying groups and actions.
- [group_screen.dart](lib/screens/group_screen.dart): Lists all groups a user is part of.
- [group_detailed.dart](lib/screens/group_detailed.dart): Detailed view of a group, including expenses and balances.
- [group_info_screen.dart](lib/screens/group_info_screen.dart): Shows group information and member list.
- [join_group_screen.dart](lib/screens/join_group_screen.dart): UI for joining a new group.
- [pay_expense_screen.dart](lib/screens/pay_expense_screen.dart): Screen for settling debts/payments.
- [profile_screen.dart](lib/screens/profile_screen.dart): User profile management.

Each screen is modular and managed via [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get) for routing and state management.

## App Entry Point

The app initializes in [main.dart](lib/main.dart):

dart
void main() {
  runApp(const BillSplitApp());
}


- Uses GetMaterialApp for navigation.
- AuthController is injected for global access.
- Initial navigation is set to the login screen.

## Dependencies

- **Flutter**: UI toolkit for building natively compiled apps.
- **GetX**: State management, routing, and dependency injection.
- **Material Design**: Standard Flutter material widgets.

_See pubspec.yaml for the full list of dependencies._
