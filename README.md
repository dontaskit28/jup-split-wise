# Jup Split Wise

A Flutter application for managing group expenses, splitting bills, and tracking payments among friends or groups â€” inspired by apps like Splitwise â€” but powered by Solana and Jupiter for seamless token-based settlements.

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

Traditional expense-splitting apps assume all users deal in the same currency or payment method. But in the crypto world, users often hold different tokens across different wallets.

**Jup Split Wise solves this** by enabling:
- Group members to **contribute using any Solana token** (e.g., BONK, JUP, SOL)
- The system to **auto-swap contributions into a preferred token** (like USDC) using Jupiter Swap API
- The bill creator to **receive full payment in their chosen token**, no matter what tokens friends contribute

**Example:**
> Rent bill = â‚¹15,000 (~180 USDC)  
> Friend A pays 500,000 BONK  
> Friend B pays 2 JUP  
> â†’ All are auto-swapped and settled to 180 USDC into the bill owner's wallet.
